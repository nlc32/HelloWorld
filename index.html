  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <p>HTML is the basic code used for creating the structure of a webpage. HTML allows you to create headings, paragraphs, breaks, and titles. Or even to include links to websites and images as you, the creator, seem fit.  </p>

    <p>I chose to take this class because I thought it would be useful to know how to do this down the road regardless of what my profession would be. Another reason why I took the class was because I was really interested in how people built and designed webpages. One thing I am sure of ias long as I know how to do it there'll be an oppurtunity to use it.  </p>
